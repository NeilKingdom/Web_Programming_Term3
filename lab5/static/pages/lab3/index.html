                <br>
                <h3>How it functions</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for <em>cascading style sheets</em>. It is used in conjunction with html to create 
                    <span style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo,violet); color: rgb(128, 128, 128);">style!</span> 
                    You may have noticed that html on its own looks pretty bland... Not to worry though, because CSS can add attributes 
                    and their respective properties to html elements such as color or positioning. It achieves this by first specifying a 
                    selector and then specifying one or more attributes=property pair(s).
                </p>

                    <dt><span style="color:rgb(180, 39, 98)">Contextual Selectors</span></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Contextual selectors are used to select html elements based on their tags alone. Specificity can be increased by
                            including a few operators. Since html uses a parent child model 
                            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>), we can include operators such as the '>'
                            bracket to singify a direct child of the parent, '~' to signify any grandchild, or '+' to signify a sibling. 
                            <br><br>
                        </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><span style="color:rgb(180, 39, 98)">Class Selectors</span></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Class selectors target html tags which have a class attribute-value matching the name of the CSS class. For 
                            example, I might declare a CSS class called .violet and then any html tag with class="violet" would inherit the 
                            properties set in the .violet class, as well as pass them down to each subsequent grandchild.
                            <br><br>
                        </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><span style="color:rgb(180, 39, 98)">Id Selectors</span></dt>
                        <dd>
                            The ID selector is very similar to that of the class selector. The ID selector, however, takes precedence over 
                            class selectors. We can therefor say that it has more <b>"weight"</b> when two attributes conflict within one 
                            element. ID selectors resemble the syntax of class selectors, but use a hash(#) rather than a period.
                            <br><br>
                        </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><span style="color:rgb(180, 39, 98)">Attribute Selectors</span></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Attribute selectors are a bit more strange than the other selectors. Attribute selectors only affect elements 
                            which share a common tag as well as attribute-value pair as specified in the attribute selector. So for
                            instance, if a had an image tag with a width of 200px eg. <mark>&lt;img src="..." width="200px"/&gt;</mark> 
                            then I could operate on it using an attribute selector eg. img[width="200px"] {...}.  
                            <br><br>
                        </dd>   
                    <br>
                    <dt><span style="color:rgb(180, 39, 98)">Pseudo Selectors</span></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Psuedo selectors select an element tag and additionally apply what are called peseudo-classes. Pseudo peseudo-classes
                            include things like :link which applies to hyperlinks that have not been visited, :hover for when your mouse is 
                            hovering over the element, :first-child to apply attributes to the first child of the selector, among a few others.
                            The syntax might look something like: eg. div:first-child {...}.

                <h3>Content Boxes</h3>
                <p>
                    Every html element has a content area/pane. They are essentially invisible boxes surrounding the element itself. This 
                    helps with placing content in the correct position! You can also affect the padding, margins and border width/height
                    to keep text from getting cluttered. 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Take a look at the border surrounding this text for example! Notice that<br>
                        even if I break the paragraph early, the border is still nearly twice as<br>
                        large. This is because I have created a selector that targets all of my<br>
                        &lt;p&gt; tags and makes their width 45% of the screen size. This is really convenient<br>
                        because my text will wrap by default rather than me having to manually add<br>
                        &lt;br&gt; tags everywhere like I currently am.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can also change the default positions of elements. Normally, images would stack on top of each other, following the
                        natural flow of the webpage. Instead though, I can modify the position attribute along with a few others so that my
                        images are positioned side by side!
